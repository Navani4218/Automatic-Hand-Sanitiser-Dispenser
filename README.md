# Automatic-Hand-Sanitiser-Dispenser

INTRODUCTION:

I have fabricated a project titled "AUTOMATIC HAND SANITISER DISPENSER". This project was created during the COVID-19 pandemic as a try to fabricate the low cost Automatic Sanitiser Dispenser.

ABSTRACT:

In 2020, the entire world has been severely affected by a virus named Covid-19 also 
known as Corona Virus. 

During that pandemic time, Masks and Hand sanitizers played an important role in maintaining cleanliness and prevented us from affecting this virus. 

But in most public places, Sanitizers are used by manually touching to dispense. This may lead to the spreading of viruses.

In order to avoid that, an Automatic Hand Sanitizer Dispenser system is proposed in this work. It will dispense without even touching it and maintain cleanliness. This proposed 
system uses Arduino Board, Ultrasonic Sensor, Servo Motor, and USB cable. 

Thus developed prototype dispenses the required amount of sanitizer by sensing the hand.

CONCLUSION:

At present, World still has a threat to people through various vital and contagious viruses which are spreading in different parts of the country. 

In several pandemic waves, we came to know about the importance of the cleanliness of an individual. 

It has registered the importance of using sanitizers and masks, especially in public places whenever required. 

Research should be further done on such technologies with a future scope and advancement of this project. 

Our project work is a small but efficient step towards cleanliness and the belief is that this project would encourage people to 
efficiently work on the associated topics. 

We built an efficient automatic sanitizer dispenser that can be used to dispense sanitizer without any manual operations like a footoperated sanitizer dispenser. 

It is a touchless process. This project will be a new solution and ultimately reduces the risk of spreading diseases among people and helps to have 
better public sanitization.
